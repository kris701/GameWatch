            Thank you for using GameWatch.
            <LineBreak/>
            This is an application where you can better control how much time you spend on different applications. 
            So instead of ending up spending 12 hours in a game, without you realising it, with GameWatch you can set limits and give yourself notifications.
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            It is simple to use, whenever your start the application, a tray icon apears down in your taskbar.
            <LineBreak/>
            If you double-click on the icon, the main window will show up, here you will be able to get a quick overview of how much time you have spend in monitored applications and how much time you have left.
            All the timers reset after a day have passed.
            <LineBreak/>
            <LineBreak/>
            And that is basically it! Take a look through the program and i hope you enjoy using GameWatch.
